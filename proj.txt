##### Project Goals ! #####
# The point of this project is to serve as a library for pathfinding, but also as a plugin for...
well, no particular reason. Easier testing? I guess. (USE UNIT TESTS)

# We need to allow as much flexibility as possible. So, goals:
* Be fast, efficient and simple. (Of course...)
* Allow full control over the code to the developer interacting via the API. I don't want 20
different tasks secretly scheduled.
* Allow flexibility. Flexibility includes:
- Making the code compatible with Async/Sync. For example, instead of giving (or
dependency injecting) the World class to the pathfinder.obj, give an array of `Node`s which would
contain (e.g:) Block state and coordinates.
- Allowing extensive debugging of what's going on behind-the-scenes, like allowing to get the
currently resolved path at any point of the pathfinding.
* Have some built-in, automatically configured easy-to-use pathfinding... things.
* U n i t t e s t s.

##### Implementation Details #####

# What do we need for the pathfinding?
* A score for each node. This can be manually provided, or automatically found using the block.
* A 'from' node, and a 'to/target' node.
* Every node to scan in-between, within a radius (so we don't scan the entire world and quickly
fill up memory and cause other side effects).

# From the API usage side, how could a developer find the optimal path to something?
; Now, one thing to keep in mind here is that we won't always need an 'optimal' optimal path.
For example, who would want their cool WitherBoss entity to start breaking glass blocks to reach
a player just because it's faster? So, let's introduce modes; walk/jump-only mode and break-blocks
-mode.

; We also need settings. Sometimes, the developer knows how many blocks exactly they would want to
search something. Maybe they have a set arena they want to pathfind in, and everything else
outside that arena is void? So, let's introduce PfSettings. PfSettings would currently consist
of:
1. Radius; of getting the nodes. X/Y/Z
2. PfMode; walk-jump-mode/break-blocks-mode
2. ScoreRegistery; basically a register for storing the 'score' for each Block. Allow a
`setTemplate(PfMode mode)` which basically configures it automatically based off of the mode.
THIS REGISTER WILL NOT STORE ANYTHING PERMANENTLY AND MUST BE INSTANTIATED EVERYTIME.
...
So, based on that, we could do something like:
PfJob job = (new Pathfinder(World, new PfSettings(
  Radius::autoAdjust($from, $to),
  PfMode::WALK_ONLY
));
Now, `job` is thread-safe, and so we can pass it anywhere to calculate the optimal path.
...

# How does Pathfinder calculate nodes for PfJob?
* To make PfJob thread-safe, we need to keep it from interacting with the main thread. Because...
well, we don't need to. So PfJob only accepts an array of `Node`s, which then using scores and
such it calculates the optimal path for. The ONLY responsibility for PfJob is to calculate
the optimal path using the *given* values. It will not generate anything new of its own or make
any assumptions.

* Now, the job of `Pathfinder` is to feed the `PfJob` with data. Let's look at what data `PfJob`
needs: list of nodes, and preferably an explicit start/target node.
The list of nodes is what will be browsed through to find the optimal path. And the job of
`Pathfinder` is to find this very list of nodes. It will do this Insha'Allah by the optimal
method; currently using an XYZ radius to iterate through the present coordinates, determine
their score, create a `Node` object out of them and then proceed. But, complications can occur...

* `PfNode`:
- Coordinates (Vec3)
- Score
